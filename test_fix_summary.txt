Summary of recent fixes and test status

- test_operator, test_named_expressions, test_typing, and test_generators all pass via scripts/run_cpython_tests.sh.
- Named expressions: named target assignment now uses a temp; class-scoped named targets avoid polluting locals.
- Typing: type params are bound outside class namespace; implicit Generic base added when needed; class annotations preserve order.
- Generators: suppressed exceptions keep __context__ while tracebacks are cleared.
- Added integration tests + transform fixtures for named expressions, typing generics, and generator exception context.
- Regenerated transform fixtures with cargo run --bin regen_fixtures.
